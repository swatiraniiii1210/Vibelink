## 🚨 Problem Statement

Most networking and dating platforms rely heavily on profiles, photos, and swiping mechanisms.

These traditional approaches fail to measure:

- Real communication chemistry  
- Personality compatibility  
- Interaction quality  

As a result, users struggle to build meaningful and genuine connections based on actual behavioral compatibility.

---

## 🌍 Why This Is Important

- Genuine connections improve collaboration, friendships, mentorship, and relationships.  
- Gen-Z prefers interactive, engaging platforms instead of static profile browsing.  
- The future of connection is experience-based, not appearance-based.

---

## 💡 Our Solution — VibeLink

**VibeLink** is a gamified, reality-show-inspired platform that matches people based on communication, personality, and behavior instead of profile pictures.

Users join themed **Connection Rooms** such as:

- Friendship  
- Love  
- Mentorship  
- Travel  
- Collaboration  

Instead of swiping, participants go through interactive compatibility challenges.

---

## 🎮 Core Features

### 🔹 Question Round (Real Talk)
Participants answer meaningful real-time questions to measure personality alignment.

### 🔹 Synergy Team Round
